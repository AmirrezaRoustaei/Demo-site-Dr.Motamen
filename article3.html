    <h2>Invisalign treatment</h2>
    <p>Invisalign treatment is popular for those who want a more discreet way to straighten their teeth. Instead of brackets and wires like traditional braces, Invisalign treatment uses a series of clear aligners that are custom-made for your teeth. These aligners are virtually invisible when worn, making them a great option for those concerned about their appearance during orthodontic treatment.</p>

    <p>One benefit of Invisalign treatment is the flexibility it offers. The aligners are removable; you can take them out when you eat, brush, and floss. These make it much easier to maintain good oral hygiene compared to traditional braces. In addition, Invisalign aligners are more comfortable than metal braces since they don't have any sharp edges or wires.</p>

    <p>Invisalign treatment is effective for a variety of orthodontic issues, including overcrowding, gaps, and minor bite problems. However, it may not be suitable for more severe cases. Your orthodontist will assess if Invisalign treatment is the right option for you. Orthopedic surgery or orthopedics (alternative spelling orthopaedics) is the branch of surgery concerned with conditions involving the musculoskeletal system. Orthopedic surgeons use both surgical and nonsurgical means to treat musculoskeletal trauma, spine diseases, sports injuries, degenerative diseases, infections, tumors and congenital disorders.</p>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>Nicholas Andry coined the word in French as orthopédie, derived from the Ancient Greek words ὀρθός orthos ("correct", "straight") and παιδίον paidion ("child"), and published Orthopedie (translated as Orthopædia: Or the Art of Correcting and Preventing Deformities in Children) in 1741. The word was assimilated into English as orthopædics; the ligature æ was common in that era for ae in Greek- and Latin-based words. As the name implies, the discipline was initially developed with attention to children, but the correction of spinal and bone deformities in all stages of life eventually became the cornerstone of orthopedic practice.</p>

    <p>Differences in spelling: As with many words derived with the "æ" ligature, simplification to either "ae" or just "e" is common, especially in North America. In the US, the majority of college, university, and residency programmes, and even the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, still use the spelling with the digraph ae, though hospitals usually use the shortened form. Elsewhere, usage is not uniform; in Canada, both spellings are acceptable; "orthopaedics" is the normal spelling in the UK in line with other fields which retain "ae".</p>
